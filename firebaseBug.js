The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the app's configuration is incorrect or if there's a network issue preventing it from connecting to Firebase services.  Another potential problem is when using Realtime Database rules that are too restrictive, leading to unexpected data access failures.  Furthermore, asynchronous operations (like database reads/writes) might not be handled correctly, causing race conditions or unexpected behavior. Lastly, improper handling of authentication can result in authorization errors.
